## About

<p>Launched in June 2021, <b>NASA<b> or <b>Not Another Shit Altcoin<b> is a token deployed on the Binance Smart Chain network that utilizes the raw power of memes, transparency, innovation and pure fundamentals to facilitate its goal of becoming the dependable altcoin of the future.

  NASA stands out because it has character, originality, tokenomics that prohibit rug pulls, an authentic community that wasn't built on the foundation of bots, and a team of amazing individuals with years of crypto experience between them.
  
  NASA is a deflationary, reflective, self-sustaining DeFi token. This is made possible by NASA's 10% tax on all transactions structure, 5% of which is reflected back to each and every holder and the other 5% goes towards the locked liquidity pool.
  
  The founder of NASA originates from Auckland, New Zealand while the rest of the crew are all spread out across different parts of the globe. They are fully doxed (just visit [nasatoken.net](http://nasatoken.net) for more info) and armed with a wide range of skill sets that make them perfect candidates for creating a successful token.</p>


## Use Case The Dependable Altcoin of the Future
![ ](https://github.com/nasatoken/NASA-Whitepaper/blob/main/images/Nasa-Dependable-Altcoin.jpg)
<p>NASA aims to solve to the best of its abilities a very unfortunate side effect of investing in crypto which is the threat of a rug pull and or the developers giving up on a project. There is a huge opportunity out there for a token that truly puts the interests of the investor first and we believe NASA is that token. Every action and decision made is done so with good intentions and is driven by this underlining principle. 

  NASA's tagline is "The Dependable Altcoin of the Future" for a reason. We feel it encapsulates and sums up our aim nicely and communicates effectively to the community in just a few short words what we are trying to achieve. Continue reading for more details. </p>


## Ownership Renounced
![ ](https://github.com/nasatoken/NASA-Whitepaper/blob/main/images/Ownership-Renounced.png)
<p>Ownership was renounced on June 06, 2021.</p>
<a href="https://bscscan.com/tx/0x02c5dc9e329da9b20620daabc786c80adb754a317201bbffddbc16d9c309b38e#eventlog">Transaction Hash</a>



## The smart contract contains no lock/unlock functions
<p>A lot of people do not know this but a very common risk factor for tokens is their ability to "fake" renounced ownership without investors being any the wiser. This is made possible by a function embedded into the smart contract that allows the developer to reclaim ownership once it has been renounced. NASA listened to the concerns of the community and made the easy decision of removing this line of code completely from the smart contract.</p>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nanuaf/safemoon_clones_can_fake_renounced_ownership_and/">For more info visit here</a>


## Locked liquidity pool until 2100
<p> The liquidity pool was locked through DxSale for the maximum amount of time allowed.

Investors can sleep soundly at night knowing that the liquidity pool will never be unlocked in their lifetime, eliminating the risk of a discrete rug pull later on down the track.</p>
![ ](https://github.com/nasatoken/NASA-Whitepaper/blob/main/images/liquidity-locked.png)

## Excellent wallet distribution
<p>NASA held a Whitelist presale before launching on DxSale. Loyal members of the community were given an opportunity to purchase tokens early to ensure that in the event of bot attack on DxSale that the token would also be propped up by individuals that supported the project/holders.

To avoid the risk of whales buying up large qualities of NASA and controlling the supply a max buy limit of 1 BNB per person/wallet was implemented for both the Whitelist and DxSale. This proved to be a very wise decision as NASA tokens are now distributed fairly evenly across all wallets. Refer to the *wallet distributions* section down [below](#Wallet Distribution) for more details.</p>


## Full transparency and a globally doxed team
<p>NASA is committed to being one of the most transparent tokens on the crypto market. No information is withheld from the public simply because NASA has nothing to hide. This Whitepaper will act as the main resource for finding all important information in one place, however, if you discover that something is not quite explained in detail enough or you need more clarification on a subject then head on over to one of our many social media platforms (links are provided [here](https://www.notion.so/NASA-Token-s-Live-Whitepaper-e36eaf6a194244479767bd188aa1271b)) and a helpful staff member will be able to point you in the right direction.

In addition to this, the team of professionals working on NASA are doxed. As you can see from the map below, NASA is comprised of a global network of individuals who have banded together to achieve one common goal.

## ID verified audit by Dessert Finance
![ ](https://github.com/nasatoken/NASA-Whitepaper/blob/main/images/dessert-finance.png)

<p> Dessert Finance created an extensive and thorough Audit on the NASA token. You can read it for yourself <a href="https://dessertswap.finance/idverified.html">here</a>. Dessert Finance had high praise for NASA and only highlighted two possible risk signs none of which were concerned with the smart contract itself.

The risk signs were related to use case and domain name registration. The use case was not made common knowledge prior to the audit - this is no longer an issue and has since been fixed.

In regards to the domain name registration, Dessert Finance likes to see domains registered for longer than a year. At the time of submission, nasatoken.net did not meet this requirement but as shown in the screenshot below, it does now.</p>


## Open communication lines and channels
<p>The NASA team are always on hand to answer questions and chit chat with the community. As highlighted in the map above, we have team members in all areas of the globe. NASA operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.</p>

## Coming Soon 

## 1. NASA Audit Services
<p>This is a project we are extremely bullish on and it makes sense from a branding and marketing point of view. 

We have a dedicated team of blockchain developers in charge of this and we are currently in the early stages of auditing our first token, more details will be made available as we near closer to releasing our findings. 

Below is a short rundown of how the process will work:

1. Token hires us to audit their project
2. Token pays a fee of which is reinvested back into NASA
3. NASA's team of experts scan the smart contract line by line and highlight any risk factors
4. NASA gives the token a grade, compiles its findings into an easy to read report and publishes the results
5. A token becomes NASA Certified if it meets a certain criteria and or threshold. This is essentially recognition that this token passes all our checks and based on the results it is Not Another Shit Altcoin
6. NASA creates an NFT for the most worthy projects that will be displayed on nasatoken.net and shared across all social media platforms bringing attention and hype to the newly audited token
</p>

<p>
Proof of concept. Selected audited tokens will receive an animated NFT equipped with a "NASA Certified" stamp and grade.</p>



## 2. Rug Pull Relief Fund
<p>There's nothing worse than getting excited about a project or new token launch only to have your hard earned investment pulled unexpectedly by bad actors. At NASA, a portion of reflections from our marketing wallet will be used to give back to active NASA investors who have been rug pulled on other investments via an application process.

A link will be available on our website shortly that will redirect the user to a form to fill out. Our staff will review the form and if the user is successful then we will match any investment they make into NASA 1:1 (up to a certain limit). The only condition is that the tokens will need to be held in a wallet for specified amount of time, after which point the person is free to do whatever they want with them.</p>


## 3. NFT marketplace
<p>The creative director at NASA has already started creating templates for some of the art that will be showcased on the marketplace. This project is still in the early development stage but see below for a little teaser of what we have in store for you.</p>

## Token mechanics

## Token burn and deflationary mechanism
<p>
NASA had an initial supply of 1,000,000,000,000 NASA which is low in comparison to other altcoins/memecoins. We opted against a large percentage burn at the start for the simple reason that if we had not, then we would potential run into supply issues in the future.

Therefore, we decided that a 5% burn (50,000,000,000 NASA) of the initial supply would be the most optimal amount for this situation. These tokens were sent to the dead address ([txn hash](https://www.notion.so/f53b6459800b2984427133a51575c2a2)) essentially removing them from the circulation forever.

By doing this, NASA becomes a deflationary token which basically means that over time the supply gradually decreases instead of increasing or staying stagnant. This is because, as mentioned earlier reflection taxes go to every holder and the dead address is no exception. The amount of tokens the holder receives is proportionate to how many NASA tokens they hold – in other words, the larger the supply of NASA tokens the larger the slice of the pie.

In summary, the burn address acts as a “black hole”. Over time, more and more tokens will be consumed or removed from circulation which in turn results in scarcity. This will allow for rising price support, increasing with volume as NASA continues to expand.</p>


## Reflection mechanism
<p>
5% of every transaction is taxed and reflected or distributed back to each holder. You might hear this process being referred to as automatic staking and or frictionless yield. Basically investors are paid passive income for just holding while the rewards are compounding over time.

Nobody is safe from the transaction fees either. This includes swing traders. So the reflection mechanism also acts as a deterrent for those looking to make a quick buck off of the price volatility which in turn contributes to a smoother ride for everybody else.

The 5% tax is fixed, and due to our renounced ownership this amount will never change. This is far superior to other more traditional Yield Farming protocols in which their APY’s are dynamic and selling pressure would result in lower profitability for all. NASA will never fall prey to this, as its reflection mechanic is built to sustain itself.</p>


## Increasing liquidity pool
<p>
A liquidity pool is a collection of funds locked in a smart contract. Liquidity pools are used to facilitate decentralized trading, lending, and many more functions.

The advantage of using liquidity pools is that it does not require a buyer and a seller to decide to exchange two assets for a given price, and instead leverages a pre-funded liquidity pool. This allows for trades to happen with limited slippage even for the most illiquid trading pairs, as long as there is a big enough liquidity pool.

The last 5% of the 10% transaction tax goes towards NASA's locked liquidity pool. This means that over time, NASA’s liquidity pool will continue to rise in relation to volume, consistently contributing to a higher and healthier price floor. Not only that but the increasing liquidity also makes NASA more resilient to dips.</p>
